    When strategies for a sustainable winegrowing industry are assessed, there is a trade-off between balancing the amount of resources invested and the resultant yield and sale price of the produce. In this analysis we observe relationships between resource use, yield and sale price through the use of statistical models. The dataset used for this analysis includes data collected for the past 10 years from 1261 vineyards located over a diverse range of Australian winegrowing regions. Yield and sale price were evaluated with respect to the resource use factors water use and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The analysis confirmed a strong relationship between area and resource use, with the overall area of a vineyard and its access to resources greatly determining the upper limit of yield. However, area was also negatively related to the average sale price of grapes; we find that higher average sale prices were connected to high resource inputs per area, rather than to the overall expenditure of resources. Regional and temporal effects on vineyard yield and average sales price were also identified. Overall, the analysis highlighted the importance of considering a vineyard's business goal, region, external pressures and economies of scale, when considering whether to pursue higher yields or higher average sales prices.
